Coding-style is a subjective matter but it helps readibility a lot.

Consistency within projects is most important, hence the following
guidelines for code that you'd like to see merged into AgentBase (you
are free to do whatever you want in your ABM models ;-)

Names:

- Use descriptive names; full words instead of single
  letters or things that are ambiguous.

  So `patch' instead of `p' or `pch', `toString' instead' of `toStr'.

- CamelCase for classnames, lowerCamelCase for variable names.

- Put classes each in their own file.

Spacing:

- Put space between your operators.

  So someVariable = 3 * 5 + (another - 11) / 7
  
  NOT someVariable=3*5+(another-11)/7 (we have minification for that)

- Space code out over multiple lines as this furthers legibility (such as 
  if, then else, etc). Don't use `then' or any ';'s.

  So

  alpha = 5
  betha = 7
  if alpha == 5
    betha = 8

  NOT alpha = 5; betha = 7; if (alpha == 5) then betha = 8

Generally:

- Don't use any javascript in code that you'd like to see merged, except
  in evals in rare cases.

- CPU & memory optimizations are nice, but if they make things too
  convoluted (especially for modelers) we will probably not want them.

Finally; enjoy beautiful code! :)
